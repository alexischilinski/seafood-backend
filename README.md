# SEAstainability

This is the backend for SEAstainability, an app built to show sustainable seafood choices.

This app is fully deployed at:
* https://mod3seafood.firebaseapp.com/
* https://mod3seafood.herokuapp.com/fish

App functionality:

* Filter through the sustainable seafood choices on the left by typing in a fish name.
* View fish that are best farmed or caught wild.
* Filter through the seafood list by clicking on a region on the map (SVG).
* Sign-up/login to view seafood choices in your area and add seafood choices to your profile.
* Click on the Dory icon to learn more about protecting our oceans.

## Getting Started/Installing

Fork and clone this repo. First use the command:

```
bundle install
```
to create your Gemfile. Since this is built with PostgreSQL, you will also need to run:

```
rails db:create
```
as well as:

```
rails db:migrate
```
and:
```
rails db:seed
```

To start the rails server, run this command:
```
rails s
```

Next, find my "seafood-frontend" repo to run the frontend file. (https://github.com/alexiscait142/seafood_frontend)
